sunlight filtering through trees

cut out holes in a sheet of payper and play in the sun,
tried to emulate it by stacking (multiplying) layers blurred random ellipses, 
did systematic experiments with a cheese grater
realised that blurred circles can not reproduce the effect
remembered that a an interrupted planar wave is equivalent to ininetly many point emmiters along its cut
implemented a confolution between one circle and a pattern of many circles
it looks very similar to the experimental cheesegrater results

did the convolution for a sinle layer of leaves, looks good, this might be the right direction


stuck at figuring out how to do several layers of leaves, something about rescaling, 
because further down in the tree the sun has not changed in apparent size, 
but the leaves further up are now relatively smaller
